What additional code would be required for the Invoice Manager application to accept multiple different file types?
add multiple attribute in the input tag to accept multiple different file type

How would you improve the Invoice Manager application? What new features would you add or improve?
Adding login and logout functionalities to the Invoice Manager application, so the CRUD operation is not available for everyone. Only
when a user is logged in can perform CRUD. Using $_SESSION can achieve this feature by storing the logged in status as session. when the user
is log out the application, the $_SESSION is destroyed.

What have you learned from completing the Invoice Manager application? How will those skills help you in the future?
I have learned how to do CRUD operation using SQL database connection. working with $_SESSION, $_POST, and $_GET. 
I have learned the differece between GET and POST in a web application.
These skills help me build robust PHP web application in the future.
