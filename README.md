What validation techniques did you use for this project?
I use sanitizing the data with trim whitespace, remove slashes, and htmlspecialchars, and the input fields are required. I tested data with special cases such as the lenght of the string cannot be more than 255 characters, the email is in correcct format.
In your own words, why is it important to add validation to the forms?
Without validation, malicious data can be sent to the server. It can croupt the date in the server with malicious data is stored on the server
What improvements or changes would you make to the project either in additional features or improvement in the existing code?
Let the user confirm the delete action, sometimes, the user hit delete by accident, and deleted the data by accident.
